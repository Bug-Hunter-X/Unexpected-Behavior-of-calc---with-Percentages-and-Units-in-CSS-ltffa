One solution is to avoid using multiple percentage values within `calc()`. Instead, explicitly calculate the desired width using fixed units or a combination of percentages and fixed units, making the calculations more predictable.   Alternatively, ensure the parent element's dimensions are correctly defined and consistent:

```css
.container {
  width: 800px; /* Explicitly set the width */
}
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 100px); /* More predictable calculation */
}
```

Another approach is to refactor the CSS to avoid the complex `calc()` calculation entirely by using a more straightforward approach.  If possible, use pre-calculated values or break down the layout into simpler components.
