The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there is a potential bug that can arise when using `calc()` with percentages and other units. Consider the following example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```

In this case, the browser might encounter difficulty in calculating the width accurately if the parent element's width is not defined properly or if there are other conflicting CSS rules involved.

Another example involves using `calc()` with multiple percentage values:

```css
.container {
  width: 80%;
}
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 20% + 10%);
}
```

This might lead to unexpected width calculation results as the browser interprets the percentages relative to different containing elements.

This error often manifests as unexpected layout issues where the element's dimensions are not as expected.
